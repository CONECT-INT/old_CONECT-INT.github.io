      <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience is in revolution: Over the past decade, tremendous technological advances across several disciplines have dramatically expanded the frontiers of experimentally accessible neuroscientific facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridging across different spatial and temporal scales, combination of in vivo two photon imaging, large population recording-array technologies, optogenetic circuit control tools, transgenic manipulations as well as large volume circuit reconstructions are now used to examine the function, structure and dynamics of neural networks on an unprecedented level of detail and precision. Current applications of these novel techniques include sensory information processing, motor production, neural correlates of learning, memory and decision making as well as mechanisms of dysfunctions and disease. These experiments have begun to produce a huge amount of data, on a broad spectrum of temporal and spatial scales, providing finer and more quantitative descriptions of the biological reality than we would have been able to dream of only a decade ago. The daunting complexity of the biological reality revealed by these technologies highlights the importance of neurophysics to provide a conceptual bridge between abstract principles of brain function and their biological implementations within neural circuits. This revolution is accompanied by a parallel revolution in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. An exponential number of algorithms in sensory processing, such as image classification, or reinforcement learning have realized practical tools which have replaced the classical tools we were using on a daily basis by a novel range of intelligent tools of a new generation. &lt;strong&gt;This is the context in which we are creating CONECT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are convinced that close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians in neuroscience is essential to develop mechanistic as well as quantitative understandings of how the brain performs its functions. This is in fact a primary motivating force in establishing this center. However, for such collaborations to be effective, experimentalists must be well aware of the approaches and challenges in modeling while theoreticians must be well acquainted with the experimental techniques, their power and the challenges they present. CoNeCt has also the ambition to contribute to the training of a new generation of neuroscientists who will have all these qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is therefore complementary but distinct in its purpose from neuroinformatics (creation of tools for analyzing neuroscientific data) or artificial intelligence (creation of algorithms inspired by the functioning of the brain). The field of computational neuroscience is still young but its community is now structured in an autonomous community with strong interaction with the other branches of neuroscience. It is this autonomy that we want to foster at INT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2020-09-11 : Feedforward and feedback processes in visual recognition (T Serre)</title>
      <link>https://CONECT-INT.github.io/event/2020-09-11_seminaire-thomas-serre/</link>

      <guid>https://CONECT-INT.github.io/event/2020-09-11_seminaire-thomas-serre/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a seminar at the Institute of Neurosciences Timone in Marseille, &lt;a href=&#34;http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Thomas Serre&lt;/a&gt; will present his recent work on &amp;ldquo;Feedforward and feedback processes in visual recognition&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress in deep learning has spawned great successes in many engineering applications. As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching – and sometimes even surpassing – human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. In this talk, however, I will show that these neural networks and their recent extensions exhibit a limited ability to solve seemingly simple visual reasoning problems involving incremental grouping, similarity, and spatial relation judgments. Our group has developed a recurrent network model of classical and extra-classical receptive fields that is constrained by the anatomy and physiology of the visual cortex. The model was shown to account for diverse visual illusions providing computational evidence for a novel canonical circuit that is shared across visual modalities. I will show that this computational neuroscience model can be turned into a modern end-to-end trainable deep recurrent network architecture that addresses some of the shortcomings exhibited by state-of-the-art feedforward networks for solving complex visual reasoning tasks. This suggests that neuroscience may contribute powerful new ideas and approaches to computer science and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT in 2006 and an MSc in EECS from Télécom Bretagne (France) in 2000. His research seeks to understand the neural computations supporting visual perception and has been featured in the BBC series “Visions from the Future” and other news articles (The Economist, New Scientist, Scientific American, IEEE Computing in Science and Technology, Technology Review and Slashdot). Dr. Serre is the Faculty Director of the Center for Computation and Visualization and the Associate Director of the Initiative for Computation in Brain and Mind at Brown University. He also holds an International Chair in AI within the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (France). Dr. Serre has served as an area chair and a senior program committee member for top-tier machine learning and computer vision conferences including AAAI, CVPR, and NeurIPS. He is currently serving as a domain expert for IARPA’s Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) program and as a scientific advisor for Vium, Inc. He was the recipient of an NSF Early Career Award as well as DARPA’s Young Faculty Award and Director’s Award.
