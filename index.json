He co-authored more than 40 articles in computational neuroscience and computer vision. He graduated from the aeronautics engineering school SUPAERO, in Toulouse (France) with a signal processing and applied mathematics degree. He received a PhD in Cognitive Science in 2003 on the mathematical analysis of temporal spike coding of images by using a multi-scale and adaptive representation of natural scenes. His research program is focusing in bridging the complex dynamics of realistic, large-scale models of spiking neurons with functional models of low-level vision. In particular, as part of the FACETS and BrainScaleS consortia, he has developed experimental protocols in collaboration with neurophysiologists to characterize the response of population of neurons. Recently, he extended models of visual processing in the framework of predictive processing in collaboration with the team of Karl Friston at the University College of London. This method aims at characterizing the processing of dynamical flow of information as an active inference process. His current challenge within the NeOpTo team is to translate, or compile in computer terminology, this mathematical formalism with the event-based nature of neural information with the aim of pushing forward the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence systems.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1619086105,"objectID":"34290dc2ee08b914b9858e658a955aa2","permalink":"https://CONECT-INT.github.io/author/laurent-u-perrinet/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/laurent-u-perrinet/","section":"authors","summary":"Laurent Perrinet is a computational neuroscientist specialized in large scale neural network models of low-level vision, perception and action, currently at the \u0026ldquo;Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone\u0026rdquo; (France), a joint research unit (CNRS / Aix-Marseille Université).","tags":null,"title":"Laurent U Perrinet","type":"authors"},{"authors":["David Hansel","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"Neuroscience is in revolution: Over the past decade, tremendous technological advances across several disciplines have dramatically expanded the frontiers of experimentally accessible neuroscientific facts.\nBridging across different spatial and temporal scales, combination of in vivo two photon imaging, large population recording-array technologies, optogenetic circuit control tools, transgenic manipulations as well as large volume circuit reconstructions are now used to examine the function, structure and dynamics of neural networks on an unprecedented level of detail and precision.
