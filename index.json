He graduated from the aeronautics engineering school SUPAERO, in Toulouse (France) with a signal processing and applied mathematics degree. He received a PhD in Cognitive Science in 2003 on the mathematical analysis of temporal spike coding of images by using a multi-scale and adaptive representation of natural scenes. His research program is focusing in bridging the complex dynamics of realistic, large-scale models of spiking neurons with functional models of low-level vision. In particular, as part of the FACETS and BrainScaleS consortia, he has developed experimental protocols in collaboration with neurophysiologists to characterize the response of population of neurons. Recently, he extended models of visual processing in the framework of predictive processing in collaboration with the team of Karl Friston at the University College of London. This method aims at characterizing the processing of dynamical flow of information as an active inference process. His current challenge within the NeOpTo team is to translate, or compile in computer terminology, this mathematical formalism with the event-based nature of neural information with the aim of pushing forward the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence systems.\n","date":1662559200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1662559200,"objectID":"34290dc2ee08b914b9858e658a955aa2","permalink":"https://conect-int.github.io/authors/laurent-u-perrinet/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/laurent-u-perrinet/","section":"authors","summary":"Laurent Perrinet is a computational neuroscientist specialized in large scale neural network models of low-level vision, perception and action, currently at the “Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone” (France), a joint research unit (CNRS / Aix-Marseille Université, UMR7289).","tags":null,"title":"Laurent U Perrinet","type":"authors"},{"authors":["nicolas-meirhaeghe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655733600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1655733600,"objectID":"32cecbcee646b1047e4b863be838f20f","permalink":"https://conect-int.github.io/authors/nicolas-meirhaeghe/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/nicolas-meirhaeghe/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Nicolas Meirhaeghe","type":"authors"},{"authors":["antoine-grimaldi"],"categories":null,"content":"“Ultra-fast vision using Spiking Neural Networks” (PhD position, 2020-09 / 2023-09) Venue: Aix-Marseille Université with the APROVIS3D grant (ANR-19-CHR3-0008-03)\nKeywords: Vision, Spiking Neural Networks, Bio-Inspired Computer Vision\nThesis director: Dr. Laurent PERRINET, Research unit: Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone (INT)\nmore at https://laurentperrinet.github.io/author/antoine-grimaldi/\n","date":1639134000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1639134000,"objectID":"c2f0a6a942593f19f40fafaac178a1ee","permalink":"https://conect-int.github.io/authors/antoine-grimaldi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/antoine-grimaldi/","section":"authors","summary":"“Ultra-fast vision using Spiking Neural Networks” (PhD position, 2020-09 / 2023-09) Venue: Aix-Marseille Université with the APROVIS3D grant (ANR-19-CHR3-0008-03)\nKeywords: Vision, Spiking Neural Networks, Bio-Inspired Computer Vision\nThesis director: Dr. Laurent PERRINET, Research unit: Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone (INT)","tags":null,"title":"Antoine Grimaldi","type":"authors"},{"authors":["david-hansel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1632182400,"objectID":"cca39b7dabd5880271fac7809eab8503","permalink":"https://conect-int.github.io/authors/david-hansel/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/david-hansel/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"David Hansel","type":"authors"},{"authors":["anna-montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"45d66edaf2e796c6cc66249755f036b9","permalink":"https://conect-int.github.io/authors/anna-montagnini/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/anna-montagnini/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Anna Montagnini","type":"authors"},{"authors":["emmanuel-dauce"],"categories":null,"content":"Emmanuel Daucé is associate professor at the Ecole Centrale de Marseille, doing his research in Computational Neuroscience at the Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone (France), a joint research unit (CNRS / Aix-Marseille Université).

Current applications of these novel techniques include sensory information processing, motor production, neural correlates of learning, memory and decision making as well as mechanisms of dysfunctions and disease. These experiments have begun to produce a huge amount of data, on a broad spectrum of temporal and spatial scales, providing finer and more quantitative descriptions of the biological reality than we would have been able to dream of only a decade ago. The daunting complexity of the biological reality revealed by these technologies highlights the importance of neurophysics to provide a conceptual bridge between abstract principles of brain function and their biological implementations within neural circuits. This revolution is accompanied by a parallel revolution in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. An exponential number of algorithms in sensory processing, such as image classification, or reinforcement learning have realized practical tools which have replaced the classical tools we were using on a daily basis by a novel range of intelligent tools of a new generation. This is the context in which we are creating CONECT.\nWe are convinced that the close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians in neuroscience is essential to develop mechanistic as well as quantitative understandings of how the brain performs its functions. This is in fact a primary motivating force in establishing this center. However, for such collaborations to be effective, experimentalists must be well aware of the approaches and challenges in modeling while theoreticians must be well acquainted with the experimental techniques, their power and the challenges they present. CONECT has also the ambition to contribute to the training of a new generation of neuroscientists who will have all these qualities.\nThis approach is therefore complementary but distinct in its purpose from neuroinformatics (creation of tools for analyzing neuroscientific data) or artificial intelligence (creation of algorithms inspired by the functioning of the brain). The field of computational neuroscience is still young but its community is now structured in an autonomous community with strong interaction with the other branches of neuroscience.

Question How does neural population dynamics relate to behaviorally-relevant computations?\nChallenge At any given instant, hundreds of billions of cells in our brains are lighting up in a complicated yet highly coordinated manner to give rise to our thoughts, percepts, and movements. A single neuron may be connected to thousands of other cells, sending out and receiving information through electrical impulses called spikes. From an engineering perspective, these spikes form a signal that may be viewed as a series of ones and zeros rapidly unfolding in time. Altogether, these signals reflect the ongoing computations taking place inside the nervous system, and as such, constitute a window into the brain’s inner workings. Recent advances in recording techniques have allowed experimenters to collect data from hundreds to thousands of neurons simultaneously while animals perform simple tasks. Dealing with such high-dimensional data poses important technical challenges that require elaborate methods for data mining and analysis. In this project, students will deal with datasets of increasing complexity and develop a set of analyses to extract meaningful information from the data.\nType of data Data that will be shared by the teaching staff, under the BIDS standard data organization which is currently being extended to electrophysiology data by the members of the INT and the CONECT team.

Measurements from a 2AFC experiment can be modelled using signal detection theory (SDT) from which the psychometric function can be derived theoretically. Recent efforts to combine SDT with Bayesian probabilities has linked thresholds and biases to hypothesized prior knowledge and optimal encoding/decoding [1]. From another perspective, the maximum likelihood difference scaling (MLDS) paradigm is a more recent method that allows the experimenter to estimate a perceptual scale that links a physical property to a psychological dimension [2]. Such a perceptual scale is obtained from the comparison of relative differences between pairs of stimuli. Here again, the underlying model can be understood in terms of SDT and Bayesian probabilities. However, no comparison between MLDS and 2AFC measurements has been performed yet. Here, we introduce the theory that unifies those measurements and we present some preliminary experimental results. In this context, we further explore how MLDS measurements could help to understand the perception of more complex textures generated from the statistic of deep neural network features [3].\n[1] Wei, X.

However, the learning rules that enable neurons to predict and fire ahead of sensory inputs remain largely unknown. We propose a plasticity rule based on predictive processing, where the neuron learns a low-rank model of the synaptic input dynamics in its membrane potential. Neurons thereby amplify those synapses that maximally predict other synaptic inputs based on their temporal relations, which provide a solution to an optimization problem that can be implemented at the single-neuron level using only local information. Consequently, neurons learn sequences over long timescales and shift their spikes towards the first inputs in a sequence. We show that this mechanism can explain the development of anticipatory motion signaling and recall in the visual system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learning rule gives rise to several experimentally observed STDP (spike-timing-dependent plasticity) mechanisms. These findings suggest prediction as a guiding principle to orchestrate learning and synaptic plasticity in single neurons. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.31.466667v1\nwhen: Friday 10th of December at 11am where: Salle Laurent Vinay at the Institute of Neurosciences Timone.

As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching – and sometimes even surpassing – human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. In this talk, however, I will show that these neural networks and their recent extensions exhibit a limited ability to solve seemingly simple visual reasoning problems involving incremental grouping, similarity, and spatial relation judgments. Our group has developed a recurrent network model of classical and extra-classical receptive fields that is constrained by the anatomy and physiology of the visual cortex. The model was shown to account for diverse visual illusions providing computational evidence for a novel canonical circuit that is shared across visual modalities. I will show that this computational neuroscience model can be turned into a modern end-to-end trainable deep recurrent network architecture that addresses some of the shortcomings exhibited by state-of-the-art feedforward networks for solving complex visual reasoning tasks. This suggests that neuroscience may contribute powerful new ideas and approaches to computer science and artificial intelligence.\nDr. Thomas Serre is an Associate Professor in Cognitive Linguistic and Psychological Sciences and an affiliate of the Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown University.

A transdisciplinary revolution across several disciplines (physics, genetics, biology, robotics, psychiatry, ..) and multiple scales (from micro to macro, from short to long-term, from theory to biology) new frontiers … and new challenges daunting complexity of the biological reality revealed by these technologies highlights the importance of neurophysics to provide a conceptual bridge between abstract principles of brain function and their biological implementations within neural circuits. This revolution is accompanied by a parallel revolution in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. An exponential number of algorithms in sensory processing, such as image classification, or reinforcement learning have realized practical tools which have replaced the classical tools we were using on a daily basis by a novel range of intelligent tools of a new generation. This is the context in which we are creating CONECT. CoNeCt: Computational Neuroscience Center close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians share state-of-the-art (experimentalists well aware of theoretical approaches, experimental techniques for theoreticians) complementary in its purpose from neuroinformatics… but distinct We are convinced that close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians in neuroscience is essential to develop mechanistic as well as quantitative understandings of how the brain performs its functions. This is in fact a primary motivating force in establishing this center. However, for such collaborations to be effective, experimentalists must be well aware of the approaches and challenges in modeling while theoreticians must be well acquainted with the experimental techniques, their power and the challenges they present. CoNeCt has also the ambition to contribute to the training of a new generation of neuroscientists who will have all these qualities. This approach is therefore complementary but distinct in its purpose from neuroinformatics (creation of tools for analyzing neuroscientific data) or artificial intelligence (creation of algorithms inspired by the functioning of the brain). The field of computational neuroscience is still young but its community is now structured in an autonomous community with strong interaction with the other branches of neuroscience.
