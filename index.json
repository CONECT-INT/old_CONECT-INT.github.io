Current applications of these novel techniques include sensory information processing, motor production, neural correlates of learning, memory and decision making as well as mechanisms of dysfunctions and disease. These experiments have begun to produce a huge amount of data, on a broad spectrum of temporal and spatial scales, providing finer and more quantitative descriptions of the biological reality than we would have been able to dream of only a decade ago. The daunting complexity of the biological reality revealed by these technologies highlights the importance of neurophysics to provide a conceptual bridge between abstract principles of brain function and their biological implementations within neural circuits. This revolution is accompanied by a parallel revolution in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. An exponential number of algorithms in sensory processing, such as image classification, or reinforcement learning have realized practical tools which have replaced the classical tools we were using on a daily basis by a novel range of intelligent tools of a new generation. This is the context in which we are creating CONECT.\nWe are convinced that the close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians in neuroscience is essential to develop mechanistic as well as quantitative understandings of how the brain performs its functions.

CONECT has also the ambition to contribute to the training of a new generation of neuroscientists who will have all these qualities.\nThis approach is therefore complementary but distinct in its purpose from neuroinformatics (creation of tools for analyzing neuroscientific data) or artificial intelligence (creation of algorithms inspired by the functioning of the brain).

In the first study, I’ll introduce a simple model of the visual cortex based on predictive coding mechanisms, in which physiological communication delays between levels generate alpha-band rhythms. Interestingly, these oscillations propagate as traveling waves across levels, both forward (during visual stimulation) and backward (during rest). Remarkably, experimental EEG data matched the predictions of our model. The second study refines the results of the first one, demonstrating that the direction of propagation of alpha-band waves is task dependent. Specifically, forward waves (from occipital to frontal regions) prevail during visual processing, whereas backward waves (from frontal to occipital areas) occur predominantly without visual stimulation. The last study explores the effect of a powerful psychedelics drug, N,N, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), on alpha-band oscillations, considering a model proposed in the literature based on Predictive Coding. Despite participants being in the eye-closed condition, DMT elicits a spatio-temporal pattern of cortical activation (i.e. travelling waves) similar to that produced by visual stimulation, in line with the predictions of the proposed model. Lastly, I’ll show some preliminary results about the role of oscillatory traveling waves in schizophrenic patients, interpreting the results in the light of Predictive Coding.\nAndrea Alamia is a CNRS researcher at the Brain and Cognition Research Center (CerCo) in Toulouse (France).

Here, we introduce a three-level computational model of information processing and acquisition of cognitive abilities. We propose minimal architectural requirements to build these levels and how the parameters affect their performance and relationships. The first sensorimotor level handles local nonconscious processing, here during a visual classification task. The second level or cognitive level globally integrates the information from multiple local processors via long-ranged connections and synthesizes it in a global, but still nonconscious manner. The third and cognitively highest level handles the information globally and consciously. It is based on the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) theory and is referred to as conscious level. We use trace and delay conditioning tasks to, respectively, challenge the second and third levels. Results first highlight the necessity of epigenesis through selection and stabilization of synapses at both local and global scales to allow the network to solve the first two tasks. At the global scale, dopamine appears necessary to properly provide credit assignment despite the temporal delay between perception and reward. At the third level, the presence of interneurons becomes necessary to maintain a self-sustained representation within the GNW in the absence of sensory input. Finally, while balanced spontaneous intrinsic activity facilitates epigenesis at both local and global scales, the balanced excitatory-inhibitory ratio increases.\nMore info: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2201304119\nKeywords: computational biology, dynamical systems, medical machine learning (ML), neuroscience, AI ethics\nGuillaume Dumas is an Associate Professor of Computational Psychiatry in the Faculty of Medicine at the Université de Montréal, and the Principle Investigator of the Precision Psychiatry and Social Physiology laboratory at the CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center.

This project aims to develop a method for the automated detection of repeating spiking motifs, possibly noisy, in ongoing activity. A diversity of formalizations and detection methods have been proposed and we will focus on several example measures for event/spike trains, to be compared on both synthetic and real data.\nAn implementation could be based on autodifferentiable networks as implemented in Python libraries like pytorch. This framework allows for the tuning of parameters with specific architectures like convolutional layers that can capture various timescales in spike patterns (e.g. latencies) in an automated fashion. Another recent tool based on the estimation of firing probability for a range of latencies has been proposed (Grimaldi ICIP 2022). This will be compared with existing approaches like Elephant’s SPADE or decoding techniques based on computed statistics computed on smoothed spike trains (adapted from time series processing, see (Lawrie, biorxiv).\nOne part concerns the generation of realistic synthetic data producing spike trains which include spiking motifs with specific latencies or comodulation of firing rate. The goal is to test how these different structures, which rely on specific assumptions about e.g. stationarity or independent firing probability across time, can be captured by different detection methods.\n","date":1669626000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669626000,"objectID":"1138cff36b9a221e820b3aa96cbad717","permalink":"https://conect-int.github.io/talk/2022-11-28-conect-at-the-int-brainhack-automatic-detection-of-spiking-motifs-in-neurobiological-data/","publishdate":"2022-11-28T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022-11-28-conect-at-the-int-brainhack-automatic-detection-of-spiking-motifs-in-neurobiological-data/","section":"event","summary":"TL;DR This project aims to develop a method for the automated detection of repeating spiking motifs, possibly noisy, in ongoing activity.

Although based on common biophysical principles, the dynamics of retinal neurons are quite different from their cortical counterparts, raising interesting problems for modellers. In this paper, I address some mathematically stated questions in this spirit, discussing, in particular: (1) How could lateral amacrine cell connectivity shape the spatio-temporal spike response of retinal ganglion cells? (2) How could spatio-temporal stimuli correlations and retinal network dynamics shape the spike train correlations at the output of the retina? These questions are addressed, first, introducing a mathematically tractable model of the layered retina, integrating amacrine cells’ lateral connectivity and piecewise linear rectification, allowing for computing the retinal ganglion cells receptive field together with the voltage and spike correlations of retinal ganglion cells resulting from the amacrine cells networks. Then, I review some recent results showing how the concept of spatio-temporal Gibbs distributions and linear response theory can be used to characterize the collective spike response to a spatio-temporal stimulus of a set of retinal ganglion cells, coupled via effective interactions corresponding to the amacrine cells network. On these bases, I briefly discuss several potential consequences of these results at the cortical level.

However, networks are intrinsically limited to describing pairwise interactions, whereas real-world systems are often characterized by higher-order interactions involving groups of three or more units. Higher-order structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, are therefore a better tool to map the real organization of many social, biological and man-made systems. At the same time, higher-order observables, typically topological or information-theoretic in nature and often sharing the same simplicial language, have been gathering attention for their capacity to capture properties of complex systems that are invisible to standard statistical descriptions. This had led to a certain confusion between these two facets, mechanisms on one side, phenomena on the other. Here, using recent examples from both computational modeling and neuroimaging analysis, I highlight collective behaviours induced by higher-order interactions, their interface with recent advances in topological data analysis, and finally outline three key challenges for the physics of higher-order complex systems.\nDaniele Marinazzo (Ghent Univ) https://users.ugent.be/~dmarinaz/\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OJbWSLoAAAAJ\u0026amp;hl=en\nTitle: Two is company, three is a party, and how not to get lost in big parties: practical considerations on higher-order data analysis.\nAbstract: I will make the case for looking for high-order interactions in (neural) data, and for trying to do so in a principled yet feasible way (who needs yet another axiom?).

Because neural delays accumulate as information progresses through the visual system, representations encoded at each hierarchical level are based upon input that is progressively outdated with respect to the external world. This is particularly relevant to the task of localizing a moving object – because the object’s location changes with time, neural representations of its location potentially lag behind its true location. It has therefore been proposed that the visual system utilizes the predictive nature of motion to extrapolate moving objects along their trajectory. Burkitt and Hogendoorn (2021, https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2017-20.2021) showed how spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can achieve motion extrapolation in a two-layer, feedforward network of velocity-tuned neurons, by shifting the receptive-fields of second-layer neurons in the opposite direction to a moving stimulus. The current study extends this work by implementing two important changes to the network to bring it more into line with biology: we expanded the network to multiple layers to reflect the depth of the visual hierarchy, and we implemented more realistic synaptic time-courses. We examine the degree to which STDP can facilitate compensation of neural delays across six layers, and show that the multi-layer network achieves cumulative compensation comparable in magnitude to the delays incurred in visual processing. We also explore the effect of additional delays imposed on the network by the integration time of the membrane potential.\nMore about Charlie: So far in my PhD I have looked at how spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can shift feedforward connection strengths between levels of the visual hierarchy, such that higher levels encode moving objects further along their trajectory (as a mechanism for motion extrapolation). The project began with a paper by my supervisors, Hinze Hogendoorn and Tony Burkitt: https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/20/4428.abstract. I have been working on extending this model network to have 6 layers to see the combined effect of plasticity at several visual areas. I will attach my abstract for my ECVP talk here.

Question How does neural population dynamics relate to behaviorally-relevant computations?\nChallenge At any given instant, hundreds of billions of cells in our brains are lighting up in a complicated yet highly coordinated manner to give rise to our thoughts, percepts, and movements. A single neuron may be connected to thousands of other cells, sending out and receiving information through electrical impulses called spikes. From an engineering perspective, these spikes form a signal that may be viewed as a series of ones and zeros rapidly unfolding in time. Altogether, these signals reflect the ongoing computations taking place inside the nervous system, and as such, constitute a window into the brain’s inner workings. Recent advances in recording techniques have allowed experimenters to collect data from hundreds to thousands of neurons simultaneously while animals perform simple tasks. Dealing with such high-dimensional data poses important technical challenges that require elaborate methods for data mining and analysis. In this project, students will deal with datasets of increasing complexity and develop a set of analyses to extract meaningful information from the data.\nType of data Data that will be shared by the teaching staff, under the BIDS standard data organization which is currently being extended to electrophysiology data by the members of the INT and the CONECT team.

Measurements from a 2AFC experiment can be modelled using signal detection theory (SDT) from which the psychometric function can be derived theoretically. Recent efforts to combine SDT with Bayesian probabilities has linked thresholds and biases to hypothesized prior knowledge and optimal encoding/decoding [1]. From another perspective, the maximum likelihood difference scaling (MLDS) paradigm is a more recent method that allows the experimenter to estimate a perceptual scale that links a physical property to a psychological dimension [2]. Such a perceptual scale is obtained from the comparison of relative differences between pairs of stimuli. Here again, the underlying model can be understood in terms of SDT and Bayesian probabilities. However, no comparison between MLDS and 2AFC measurements has been performed yet. Here, we introduce the theory that unifies those measurements and we present some preliminary experimental results. In this context, we further explore how MLDS measurements could help to understand the perception of more complex textures generated from the statistic of deep neural network features [3].\n[1] Wei, X.

However, the learning rules that enable neurons to predict and fire ahead of sensory inputs remain largely unknown. We propose a plasticity rule based on predictive processing, where the neuron learns a low-rank model of the synaptic input dynamics in its membrane potential. Neurons thereby amplify those synapses that maximally predict other synaptic inputs based on their temporal relations, which provide a solution to an optimization problem that can be implemented at the single-neuron level using only local information. Consequently, neurons learn sequences over long timescales and shift their spikes towards the first inputs in a sequence. We show that this mechanism can explain the development of anticipatory motion signaling and recall in the visual system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learning rule gives rise to several experimentally observed STDP (spike-timing-dependent plasticity) mechanisms. These findings suggest prediction as a guiding principle to orchestrate learning and synaptic plasticity in single neurons. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.31.466667v1\nwhen: Friday 10th of December at 11am where: Salle Laurent Vinay at the Institute of Neurosciences Timone.

As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching – and sometimes even surpassing – human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. In this talk, however, I will show that these neural networks and their recent extensions exhibit a limited ability to solve seemingly simple visual reasoning problems involving incremental grouping, similarity, and spatial relation judgments. Our group has developed a recurrent network model of classical and extra-classical receptive fields that is constrained by the anatomy and physiology of the visual cortex. The model was shown to account for diverse visual illusions providing computational evidence for a novel canonical circuit that is shared across visual modalities. I will show that this computational neuroscience model can be turned into a modern end-to-end trainable deep recurrent network architecture that addresses some of the shortcomings exhibited by state-of-the-art feedforward networks for solving complex visual reasoning tasks. This suggests that neuroscience may contribute powerful new ideas and approaches to computer science and artificial intelligence.\nDr. Thomas Serre is an Associate Professor in Cognitive Linguistic and Psychological Sciences and an affiliate of the Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown University. He received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT in 2006 and an MSc in EECS from Télécom Bretagne (France) in 2000. His research seeks to understand the neural computations supporting visual perception and has been featured in the BBC series “Visions from the Future” and other news articles (The Economist, New Scientist, Scientific American, IEEE Computing in Science and Technology, Technology Review and Slashdot).

A transdisciplinary revolution across several disciplines (physics, genetics, biology, robotics, psychiatry, ..) and multiple scales (from micro to macro, from short to long-term, from theory to biology) new frontiers … and new challenges daunting complexity of the biological reality revealed by these technologies highlights the importance of neurophysics to provide a conceptual bridge between abstract principles of brain function and their biological implementations within neural circuits. This revolution is accompanied by a parallel revolution in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. An exponential number of algorithms in sensory processing, such as image classification, or reinforcement learning have realized practical tools which have replaced the classical tools we were using on a daily basis by a novel range of intelligent tools of a new generation. This is the context in which we are creating CONECT. CoNeCt: Computational Neuroscience Center close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians share state-of-the-art (experimentalists well aware of theoretical approaches, experimental techniques for theoreticians) complementary in its purpose from neuroinformatics… but distinct We are convinced that close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians in neuroscience is essential to develop mechanistic as well as quantitative understandings of how the brain performs its functions. This is in fact a primary motivating force in establishing this center. However, for such collaborations to be effective, experimentalists must be well aware of the approaches and challenges in modeling while theoreticians must be well acquainted with the experimental techniques, their power and the challenges they present. CoNeCt has also the ambition to contribute to the training of a new generation of neuroscientists who will have all these qualities. This approach is therefore complementary but distinct in its purpose from neuroinformatics (creation of tools for analyzing neuroscientific data) or artificial intelligence (creation of algorithms inspired by the functioning of the brain). The field of computational neuroscience is still young but its community is now structured in an autonomous community with strong interaction with the other branches of neuroscience. It is this autonomy that we want to foster at INT.
