      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a seminar at the Institute of Neurosciences Timone in Marseille, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathanvacher.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jonathan Vacher&lt;/a&gt; will present his recent work on &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Unifying Different Psychometric Methods : Theory and Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm is one of the main methods used to measure perceptual thresholds and biases. Measurements from a 2AFC experiment can be modelled using signal detection theory (SDT) from which the psychometric function can be derived theoretically. Recent efforts to combine SDT with Bayesian probabilities has linked thresholds and biases to hypothesized prior knowledge and optimal encoding/decoding [1]. From another perspective, the maximum likelihood difference scaling (MLDS) paradigm is a more recent method that allows the experimenter to estimate a perceptual scale that links a physical property to a psychological dimension [2]. Such a perceptual scale is obtained from the comparison of relative differences between pairs of stimuli. Here again, the underlying model can be understood in terms of SDT and Bayesian probabilities. However, no comparison between MLDS and 2AFC measurements has been performed yet. Here, we introduce the theory that unifies those measurements and we present some preliminary experimental results. In this context, we further explore how MLDS measurements could help to understand the perception of more complex textures generated from the statistic of deep neural network features [3].&lt;/p&gt;

    Dr. &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathanvacher.github.io/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Vacher&lt;/a&gt; was a student at École Normale Supérieure de Cachan (now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en&#34;&gt;Saclay&lt;/a&gt;) where he pursued a degree in mathematics and applied mathematics. He completed his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and master&amp;rsquo;s degree with a specialty in computational imaging and machine learning (&lt;a href=&#34;http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/&#34;&gt;Master MVA&lt;/a&gt;). He started a multidisciplinary PhD in mathematics (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dauphine.fr/en/research/research-centers/ceremade-umr-7534.html&#34;&gt;Paris Dauphine University, CEREMADE)&lt;/a&gt; and neuroscience (&lt;a href=&#34;https://neuropsi.cnrs.fr/fr/icn/&#34;&gt;CNRS, UNIC&lt;/a&gt;) under the supervision of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gpeyre.com/&#34;&gt;Gabriel Peyré&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/people/cyril_monier/&#34;&gt;Cyril Monier&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Jonathan was a postdoc at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New-York between 2017 and 2020 while initiating a collaboration with Pascal Mamassian from the Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs ()École Normale Supérieure de Paris) where he is currently a postdoc.

      <title>2020-09-11 : CONECT talk - &#34;Feedforward and feedback processes in visual recognition&#34; (T Serre)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a seminar at the Institute of Neurosciences Timone in Marseille, &lt;a href=&#34;http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Thomas Serre&lt;/a&gt; will present his recent work on &amp;ldquo;Feedforward and feedback processes in visual recognition&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress in deep learning has spawned great successes in many engineering applications. As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching – and sometimes even surpassing – human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. In this talk, however, I will show that these neural networks and their recent extensions exhibit a limited ability to solve seemingly simple visual reasoning problems involving incremental grouping, similarity, and spatial relation judgments. Our group has developed a recurrent network model of classical and extra-classical receptive fields that is constrained by the anatomy and physiology of the visual cortex. The model was shown to account for diverse visual illusions providing computational evidence for a novel canonical circuit that is shared across visual modalities. I will show that this computational neuroscience model can be turned into a modern end-to-end trainable deep recurrent network architecture that addresses some of the shortcomings exhibited by state-of-the-art feedforward networks for solving complex visual reasoning tasks. This suggests that neuroscience may contribute powerful new ideas and approaches to computer science and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

He received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT in 2006 and an MSc in EECS from Télécom Bretagne (France) in 2000. His research seeks to understand the neural computations supporting visual perception and has been featured in the BBC series “Visions from the Future” and other news articles (The Economist, New Scientist, Scientific American, IEEE Computing in Science and Technology, Technology Review and Slashdot). Dr. Serre is the Faculty Director of the Center for Computation and Visualization and the Associate Director of the Initiative for Computation in Brain and Mind at Brown University. He also holds an International Chair in AI within the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (France). Dr. Serre has served as an area chair and a senior program committee member for top-tier machine learning and computer vision conferences including AAAI, CVPR, and NeurIPS. He is currently serving as a domain expert for IARPA’s Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) program and as a scientific advisor for Vium, Inc.
