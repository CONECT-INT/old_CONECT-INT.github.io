      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to invite you to a mini-workshop organized as a scientific activity of the Computational Neuroscience Center (CONECT) of the INT focused on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Higher-order interactions in brain networks: from theory to data analysis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two speakers will present their work from two complementary theoretical perspectives, emerged from recent advances in network science (Giovanni Petri) and information theory (Daniele Marinazzo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the topic and/or want to learn something new, please join us in the &lt;strong&gt;salle Laurent Vinay&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday 5th October 2022&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;14:30&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the titles and abstracts of the two presentations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title: &lt;strong&gt;Between higher-order mechanisms and phenomena&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Complex networks have become the main paradigm for modelling the dynamics of complex interacting systems. However, networks are intrinsically limited to describing pairwise interactions, whereas real-world systems are often characterized by higher-order interactions involving groups of three or more units. Higher-order structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, are therefore a better tool to map the real organization of many social, biological and man-made systems. At the same time, higher-order observables, typically topological or information-theoretic in nature and often sharing the same simplicial language, have been gathering  attention for their capacity to capture properties of complex systems that are invisible to standard statistical descriptions. This had led to a certain confusion between these two facets, mechanisms on one side, phenomena on the other. Here, using recent examples from both computational modeling and neuroimaging analysis, I highlight collective behaviours induced by higher-order interactions, their interface with recent advances in topological data analysis, and finally outline three key challenges for the physics of higher-order complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: Two  is company, three is a party, and how not to get lost in big parties: practical considerations on higher-order data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: I will make the case for looking for high-order interactions in (neural) data, and for trying to do so in a principled yet feasible way (who needs yet another axiom?).
I will then loop back and show how we can find low-order descriptors of high-order interactions (we&amp;rsquo;re not good in figuring things in high dimensions).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During this CONECT seminar, &lt;a href=&#34;https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/timing/lab/people#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Charlie Sexton&lt;/a&gt; will present his recent work on &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Spike-timing dependent plasticity among multiple layers of motion-sensitive neurons: a feedforward mechanism for motion extrapolation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of the brain to represent the external world in real-time is impacted by the fact that neural processing takes time. Because neural delays accumulate as information progresses through the visual system, representations encoded at each hierarchical level are based upon input that is progressively outdated with respect to the external world. This is particularly relevant to the task of localizing a moving object – because the object’s location changes with time, neural representations of its location potentially lag behind its true location. It has therefore been proposed that the visual system utilizes the predictive nature of motion to extrapolate moving objects along their trajectory. Burkitt and Hogendoorn (2021, &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2017-20.2021&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2017-20.2021&lt;/a&gt;) showed how spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can achieve motion extrapolation in a two-layer, feedforward network of velocity-tuned neurons, by shifting the receptive-fields of second-layer neurons in the opposite direction to a moving stimulus. The current study extends this work by implementing two important changes to the network to bring it more into line with biology: we expanded the network to multiple layers to reflect the depth of the visual hierarchy, and we implemented more realistic synaptic time-courses. We examine the degree to which STDP can facilitate compensation of neural delays across six layers, and show that the multi-layer network achieves cumulative compensation comparable in magnitude to the delays incurred in visual processing. We also explore the effect of additional delays imposed on the network by the integration time of the membrane potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    More about Charlie: So far in my PhD I have looked at how spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can shift feedforward connection strengths between levels of the visual hierarchy, such that higher levels encode moving objects further along their trajectory (as a mechanism for motion extrapolation). The project began with a paper by my supervisors, Hinze Hogendoorn and Tony Burkitt: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/20/4428.abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/20/4428.abstract&lt;/a&gt;. I have been working on extending this model network to have 6 layers to see the combined effect of plasticity at several visual areas. I will attach my abstract for my ECVP talk here.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a seminar at the Institute of Neurosciences Timone in Marseille, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathanvacher.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jonathan Vacher&lt;/a&gt; will present his recent work on &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Unifying Different Psychometric Methods : Theory and Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm is one of the main methods used to measure perceptual thresholds and biases. Measurements from a 2AFC experiment can be modelled using signal detection theory (SDT) from which the psychometric function can be derived theoretically. Recent efforts to combine SDT with Bayesian probabilities has linked thresholds and biases to hypothesized prior knowledge and optimal encoding/decoding [1]. From another perspective, the maximum likelihood difference scaling (MLDS) paradigm is a more recent method that allows the experimenter to estimate a perceptual scale that links a physical property to a psychological dimension [2]. Such a perceptual scale is obtained from the comparison of relative differences between pairs of stimuli. Here again, the underlying model can be understood in terms of SDT and Bayesian probabilities. However, no comparison between MLDS and 2AFC measurements has been performed yet. Here, we introduce the theory that unifies those measurements and we present some preliminary experimental results. In this context, we further explore how MLDS measurements could help to understand the perception of more complex textures generated from the statistic of deep neural network features [3].&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Etienne Thoret (ILCB/PRISM/LIS/AMU) kindly accepted to present his research project during our novel series of CONECT-core © seminars (=seminars open to all but focused on the core theoretical scientific questions of the CONECT members):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explainable AI for computational auditory neurosciences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and deep neural networks have been raised as compelling models to simulate a broad range of tasks on signals: from classification of sound events to the prediction of human physiological state from electrophysiological data. But what do we really understand about these models and how do they process the information they have been trained to process? As users, we often use them as tools without precisely understanding their mechanistic and representational underpinnings. In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll present recent works on how we can take part of these computational systems to answer fundamental research mysteries on auditory perception, speech production and cerebral processing. Beyond acoustics and sound perception, these techniques can find applications for the modeling of a variety of systems, including computational vision in robotics, haptics and clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a seminar at the Institute of Neurosciences Timone in Marseille, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/matteosaponati&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Matteo Saponati&lt;/a&gt;, will present his recent work showing that &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Sequence anticipation and STDP emerge from a voltage-based predictive learning rule&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent behavior depends on the brain’s ability to anticipate future events. However, the learning rules that enable neurons to predict and fire ahead of sensory inputs remain largely unknown. We propose a plasticity rule based on predictive processing, where the neuron learns a low-rank model of the synaptic input dynamics in its membrane potential. Neurons thereby amplify those synapses that maximally predict other synaptic inputs based on their temporal relations, which provide a solution to an optimization problem that can be implemented at the single-neuron level using only local information. Consequently, neurons learn sequences over long timescales and shift their spikes towards the first inputs in a sequence. We show that this mechanism can explain the development of anticipatory motion signaling and recall in the visual system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learning rule gives rise to several experimentally observed STDP (spike-timing-dependent plasticity) mechanisms. These findings suggest prediction as a guiding principle to orchestrate learning and synaptic plasticity in single neurons.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a seminar at the Institute of Neurosciences Timone in Marseille, &lt;a href=&#34;http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Thomas Serre&lt;/a&gt; will present his recent work on &amp;ldquo;Feedforward and feedback processes in visual recognition&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress in deep learning has spawned great successes in many engineering applications. As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching – and sometimes even surpassing – human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. In this talk, however, I will show that these neural networks and their recent extensions exhibit a limited ability to solve seemingly simple visual reasoning problems involving incremental grouping, similarity, and spatial relation judgments. Our group has developed a recurrent network model of classical and extra-classical receptive fields that is constrained by the anatomy and physiology of the visual cortex. The model was shown to account for diverse visual illusions providing computational evidence for a novel canonical circuit that is shared across visual modalities. I will show that this computational neuroscience model can be turned into a modern end-to-end trainable deep recurrent network architecture that addresses some of the shortcomings exhibited by state-of-the-art feedforward networks for solving complex visual reasoning tasks. This suggests that neuroscience may contribute powerful new ideas and approaches to computer science and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
